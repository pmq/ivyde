1. What is Apache IvyDE?

IvyDE is the plugin which integrates Ivy into Eclipse.

IvyDE lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java
Eclipse projects. IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or
you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but
not least, IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion.

2. Status of this release 

This is the second release of IvyDE hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.

3. Major Changes in this Release

Several new features have been added to enhance the developer's experience developing on multi-module interdependent applications, 
including better support for the resolve in workspace feature, a new context menu in the package explorer, the Reverse Dependency Explorer.

The classpath container is now more tightly integrated its underlying ivy.xml resource and the launch configuration, and allows for more fine-grained 
user control of these behaviors.
