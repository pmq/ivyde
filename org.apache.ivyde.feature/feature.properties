* Managed classpath container: automatic downloads, access to the Ivy "resolve" task from your IDE, and a feature allowing you to develop interdependent multi-module applications in one workspace.\n\
* Ivy XML files editor: creation wizard, html preview and completion for Ivy XML tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\
* Ivy settings files editor: completion for XML tags, attributes, and attribute values.\n\
* Ivy console: presents every log from Ivy to assist in debugging a failing resolve.\n\
* Reverse Dependency Explorer: helps you work with conflicting dependencies amongst several projects.\n\
