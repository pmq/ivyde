Apache IvyDE will resolve the dependencies and artifacts you are requiring. Then with the pool of resolved artifacts, it has to decide which is a binary jar, which contains sources, and which contains javadocs. And also how to bind one on each other.

<h1>Finding jars types</h1>

There are three types of jars handled by Eclipse&#153;:
<ul>
    <li>the binary jars: they will be added to the classpath in oder to compile and run; they contain the .class files.</li>
    <li>the source jars/zip: they will be bound to the binary one to browse dependency sources; they are basically a zip of .java files</li>
    <li>the javadoc jars/zip: they will be bound to the binary one to browse the API documentation of the dependencies of your project; they are a zip of .html files respectin a layout produced by javadoc.</li>
</ul>

To find the binary jars, Apache IvyDE is relying on the "Accepted types" preference field you can find in the <a href="create.html">container configuration panel</a>, or in the <a href="../preferences.html#classpath">global one</a>. If the artifact has a type listed here, it is then added to the classpath.

For the sources, it is relying on the "Sources types".

For the javadocs, it is relying on the "Javadocs types".

<h1>Binding the jars</h1>

The second step is to bind a source artifact with a binary one. Apache IvyDE has the folowing algorithm:
<ul>
    <li>first if a binary jar has the same artifact name than a source one, there are bound together.</li>
    <li>if none matched, then IvyDE search for sources which have one of the suffix specified in "Sources suffixes".</li>
</ul>

For instance, searching for the sources of mylib.jar (type=jar), with the default value of "Sources suffixes" ("-source,-sources,-src"), IvyDE will look to bind it to the first one existing of:
<ul>
<li>mylib.jar (type=source)</li>
<li>mylib-source.jar (type=source)</li>
<li>mylib-sources.jar (type=source)</li>
<li>mylib-src.jar (type=source)</li>
</ul>

Note that Apache IvyDE don't care about the extension, it can be .zip too.

Same apply for javadocs with respectively "Javadocs suffixes".</textarea>
