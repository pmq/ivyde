Some projects are composed of mulpliple modules, modules having dependencies between them, dependencies managed by Ivy (of course!). Then sometimes we need to build and publish some modules before building the dependant one. Eclipse can handle classpath composed of Java project, it can handles dependencies between projects, and IvyDE can use that feature.

First every of your modules should be separated projects in Eclipse, and each of this project should have an IvyDE classpath container configured.

To enable resolution in the workspace, go into the advanced configuration panel of the classpath container and select <b>Resolve dependencies in workspace</b>.

<center><img src="../images/workspace.jpg"/></center>

<u>Important notes:</u> to make the resolve in workspace work correctly the <i>info</i> in the ivy.xml should be properly set:
<ul>
    <li>obviously the <i>org</i> and <i>name</i> </li>
    <li>if there is a <i>rev</i> specified, dependencies should specify the appropriate range</li>
    <li>if there is no <i>rev</i> specified, only dependencies with <i>lastest</i> will match</li>
    <li>the <i>status</i> should match the required one: a dependency with <i>latest.integration</i> will only match if there is <i>status="interation"</i> in the info of the dependant module</li>
</ul>

Having two projects "A" and "B" configured to use IvyDE and the workspace resolver, here is the expected resolved dependencies:

<table class="ant">
<tr><th>A dependency on B</th><th>B declared revision</th><th>result</th></tr>
<tr><td>latest.integration</td><td>1.2</td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.2</td><td>1.2</td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>[1.2,1.3)</td><td>1.2</td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.0</td><td>1.2</td><td>no project wiring</td></tr>
<tr><td>latest.integration</td><td><i>none</i></td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.2</td><td><i>none</i></td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>[1.2,1.3)</td><td><i>none</i></td><td>B wired on A</td></tr>
<tr><td>latest.integration</td><td>$version</td><td>no project wiring</td></tr>
<tr><td>1.2</td><td>$version</td><td>no project wiring</td></tr>
<tr><td>[1.2,1.3)</td><td>$version</td><td>no project wiring</td></tr>
</table>
