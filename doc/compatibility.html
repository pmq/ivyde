<h2>Upgrading/Downgrading</h2>

This version is compatible with every earlier Apache release (since 2.0.0.alpha1). Any upgrade of Apache IvyDE should work without any worries.

The reverse is not true, downgrading is not supported and may break your configuration.

<h2>Dependency on Apache Ivy</h2>

Apache IvyDE expects to be used with a version 2.1 or superior of Apache Ivy.

<h2>Eclipse&#153; integration</h2>

Apache IvyDE has been maintained to be compatible with Eclipse 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

<h2>JVM compability</h2>

Apache IvyDE has been kept compatible with Java 1.4.
