Apache IvyDE Eclipse plugin integrates Apache Ivy's dependency management into Eclipse&#153;. It lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of project which needs dependency management.

A summary of the features it provides follows:
<ul>
<li><a href="cp_container.html">Managed classpath container</a>: automatic downloads, access to the Ivy "resolve" task from your IDE, and a <a href="cpc/workspace.html">feature</a> allowing you to develop interdependent multi-module applications in one workspace.</li>
<li><a href="ivyeditor.html">Ivy XML files editor</a>: creation wizard, html preview and completion for Ivy XML tags, attributes, and attribute values.</li>
<li><a href="settingseditor.html">Ivy settings files editor</a>: completion for XML tags, attributes, and attribute values.</li>
<li><a href="cp_container.html">Ivy console</a>: presents every log from Ivy to assist in debugging a failing resolve.</li>
<li><a href="revdepexplorer.html">Reverse Dependency Explorer</a>: helps you work with conflicting dependencies amongst several projects.</li>
<li>Resolve and retrieve for non Java project: use Ivy within Eclipse to manage files non necessarly Java-related</li>
</ul>

Apache IvyDE can be also used with other plugins like <a href="cpc/wtp.html">WTP</a> and <a href="ant.html">Apache Ant</a>.
