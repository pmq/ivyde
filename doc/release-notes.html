<h1><a name="what"></a>What is Apache IvyDE?</h1>

IvyDE is the plugin which integrate Ivy into Eclipse.

IvyDE lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java
Eclipse projects. IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or
you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but
not least IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion.

<h1><a name="status"></a>Status of this release</h1>

TO BE DISCUSSED

This release contains sevral major improvements along with some bug fixes. The major
improvements are about the resolve scheduler and how retrieved artifact are handled.
Thus this release is considered as a beta one.

<h1><a name="majorchanges"></a>Major Changes in this Release</h1>

As for this release and the next ones, IvyDE now expects to be installed in Eclipse 3.4 or superior.

IvyDE has now a synchronous job to launch resolve of dependencies on the projets. So
IvyDE will be able to order the resolve of the projects in the correct order regarding
their inter dependencies. And the immediate effect is that Eclipse get notified only
one time of a classpath change, and thus triggerin only one wrokspace build.

IvyDE is now capable of having a classpath based on retrieved artifact rather than
on the cached ones.

The existing retrieve configuration are now considered "standonale" ones, as they
are independant of the classpath container. They can even now be part of non Java
project.
