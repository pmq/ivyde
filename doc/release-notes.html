<h1><a name="annoucement"></a>Release Annoucement</h1>

<tt>
The Apache IvyDE project is pleased to announce its 2.2.0 beta2 release.

The Apache IvyDE Eclipse plugin integrates Apache Ivy's dependency management into Eclipse. It lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of project which needs dependency management. Apache IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but not least Apache IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion. Get some preview here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/screenshots.html

Major changes in this release:

!!!!!!! TODO !!!!!!!!!

Compatibility:

<h1><a name="what"></a>What is Apache IvyDE?</h1>

Apache IvyDE is the Eclipse plugin which integrates Apache Ivy's dependency management into Eclipse&#153;.

Apache IvyDE lets you manage your dependencies declared in an ivy.xml in your Java Eclipse projects, or any other kind of project which needs dependency management. Apache IvyDE will contribute to the classpath of your Java project or you can make it retrieve your dependencies directly into your project. Last but not least Apache IvyDE offer editors of ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml files with completion. Get some preview here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/screenshots.html.

<h1><a name="status"></a>Status of this release</h1>

This release contains sevral major improvements along with some bug fixes. The major
improvements are about the resolve scheduler and how retrieved artifact are handled.
Thus this release is considered as a beta one.

<h1><a name="majorchanges"></a>Major Changes in this Release</h1>

As for this release and the next ones, Apache IvyDE now expects to be installed in Eclipse 3.4 or superior.

Apache IvyDE has now a synchronous job to launch resolve of dependencies on the projets. So
IvyDE will be able to order the resolve of the projects in the correct order regarding
their inter dependencies. And the immediate effect is that Eclipse get notified only
one time of a classpath change, and thus triggerin only one wrokspace build.

Apache IvyDE is now capable of having a classpath based on retrieved artifact rather than
on the cached ones.

The existing retrieve configuration are now considered "standonale" ones, as they
are independant of the classpath container. They can even now be part of non Java
project.
